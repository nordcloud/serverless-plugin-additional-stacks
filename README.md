## Overview and purpose

This plugin provides support for managing multiple AWS CloudFormation stacks
in your Serverless ~~1.x~~ **3.x** service (serverless.yml).

The plugin requires Node.js 12.x or later due to use of Object.fromEntries().

Normally, Serverless creates a single CloudFormation stack which contains
all your CloudFormation resources. If you ever delete your service, these
resources are also deleted, including data stored in S3 or DynamoDB.

The Additional Stacks Plugin allows you to move your "permanent"
resources into a separate CloudFormation stack, which is not tightly coupled
with the service. If you delete your Serverless service and deploy it again from
scratch, the permanent resources and their stored data remain untouched.

The cost of separation is that `Ref:` no longer works for directly referencing
resources between stacks. If you need such references, you'll need to define
exported stack output values and then use `Fn::ImportValue` to refer to the
value in the other stack.

However, you can also use shared Serverless variables in stack definitions. So
you can define resource names in `serverless.yml` and then refer to them
using variables like `${self:custom.tableName}`.

You can use the plugin to manage as many additional stacks as you like
in your serverless.yml, placed under the `custom.additionalStacks` section.

## Installation

To install with npm, run this in your service directory:

    npm install --save @mamezou-tech/serverless-plugin-additional-stacks

To install with yarn, run this in your service directory:

    yarn add @mamezou-tech/serverless-plugin-additional-stacks

Then add this to your `serverless.yml`:

```yml
plugins:
 - serverless-plugin-additional-stacks
```

## Configuration

To define additional stacks, add an `additionalStacks` section like this
in your `serverless.yml`:

```yml
custom:
  additionalStacks:
    permanent:
      Resources:
        S3BucketData:
          Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
          Properties:
            BucketName: ${self:service}-data
```

The syntax of the Resources section is identical to the normal resources
in `serverless.yml`, so you can just cut-paste resource definitions around.

The full name of the deployed CloudFormation stack will include the service
name. If your service is called `my-service` and you deploy it to the `dev`
stage, the additional stack would be called `my-service-dev-permanent`.

### Customizing additional stacks

The plugin supports some directives you can use to control how your
additional stacks are deployed. They are described below.

```yml
custom:
  additionalStacks:
    stackName:
      Deploy: After
      DeployParameters: []
      StackName: CustomName
      Resources: ...

```

#### Deploy: Before|After

By default, additional stacks are deployed *before* the main Serverless
CloudFormation resources. This ensures they are immediately available when your
Lambda functions start running.

If you need to deploy an additional stack *after* other CloudFormation
resources, you can add `Deploy: After` to its definition.

#### DeployParameters: [...]

By default, stacks are deployed with empty parameters ([]). You can use
`DeployParameters: [...]` to specify parameters as an array with the same syntax
that the AWS SDK createStack() and updateStack() functions use. It looks like
this in YAML:

```yml
DeployParameters:
  - ParameterKey: param1
    ParameterValue: value1
  - ParameterKey: param2
    ParameterValue: value2
```

#### StackName: CustomName

By default, additional CloudFormation stacks are named by appending the
specified *stackName* to the Serverless stack name. If you want to customize
the CloudFormation name of the stack, you can specify `StackName: CustomName`.
This is useful for controlling existing stacks.

## Command Line Usage

Your additional stacks will be deployed automatically when you run:

    sls deploy

To deploy all additional stacks without deploying the Serverless service, you can use:

    sls deploy additionalstacks

To deploy an additional stack individually, you can use:

    sls deploy additionalstacks --stack [stackname]

To only deploy the Serverless service without deploying additional stacks, you can use:

    sls deploy --skip-additionalstacks

If you want to remove an additional stack, you need to run:

    sls remove additionalstacks --stack [stackname]

Or you can remove all additional stacks in the service with:

    sls remove additionalstacks

Alternatively, you can remove stacks manually in AWS CloudFormation Console.
